# TreeStruct
By using this program, you can create a text-based tree structure similar to a folder tree structure. To run it, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. Then, by cloning this repository and executing the following command, you can provide a JSON file as input and receive a text file named "tree.txt" as output, containing the desired tree structure.
```shell
node app.js path='input.json'
```
